## 💻 Usage

InboxMaid is a console application that runs in your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal app), where it will prompt you for input and display information.

After following the installation steps, navigate to the `InboxMaid` directory in your terminal and run the application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The application will then guide you through the process:

1.  **Enter your Email Address and App Password:** InboxMaid will prompt you for your credentials.
2.  **IMAP Server Configuration:** You can use the default Yahoo IMAP server or specify a different one.
3.  **Scan Limit:** Choose how many recent emails you want InboxMaid to scan for newsletters.
4.  **Select Mode:**
    *   **Interactive Mode (default):** Review each newsletter one by one, with options to open the unsubscribe link, delete the email, or skip.
    *   **Batch Mode:** See a numbered list of all found newsletters and select multiple to unsubscribe from at once.
5.  **Unsubscribe/Delete:** Follow the prompts to clean up your inbox!

Once finished, InboxMaid will provide a summary of your session and disconnect securely.

## ⚙️ Configuration

- You’ll need your email address and an app password (for Yahoo/Gmail, see their security settings)
- InboxMaid never stores your credentials

### Generating an App Password for Yahoo Mail  
  
InboxMaid connects to your email via IMAP, which often requires an **app password** instead of your regular email password for security reasons.  
  
**What is an App Password?**    
An app password is a special password generated by your email provider that allows third-party apps (like InboxMaid) to access your email securely without using your main account password.  
  
**How to generate an App Password, for example, with Yahoo Mail:**  
  
1. Sign in to your Yahoo Account Security page:    
   [https://login.yahoo.com/account/security](https://login.yahoo.com/account/security)  
  
2. Under **Other ways to sign in**, find **App passwords** and click **Generate app password**.  
  
3. Select or enter a custom name for the app (e.g., “InboxMaid”) and click **Generate**.  
  
4. Copy the generated app password.  
  
5. Use this app password in InboxMaid when prompted for your email password.

> **Note:** The process for generating an app password or enabling third-party app access varies by email provider.  
> If you use a different provider (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, iCloud), please check their official documentation for instructions on generating app passwords or enabling IMAP access.
